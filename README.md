# Wine-Quality-Prediction

## OBJECTIVE:
The repository is a learning excercise to:

- Apply the basic machine learning concept to an existing dataset.
- Train the model and predict the values for future.
- Creating a notebook and writing all computational records in it.

The analysis is divided into following sections:

- Importing the libraries and dataset
- Visualisation of dataset
- Splitting the dataset into training and test set
- Training the model on the training set
- Predicting the accuracy of different models
